# Redirector

Python Flask server that redirects visitors to other web page URLs.

Lots still to-do:

- Add user authentication to configuration page
- Rename about page to landing page
- Add redirect from links list to landing page
- Add reorder option to config page
- Add group option to config page
- Test different configuration file write/read error scenarios
