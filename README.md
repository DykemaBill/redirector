# Redirector

Python Flask server that redirects visitors to other web page URLs.

Lots still to-do:

- Move all CSS to one file
- Log everything as the server runs
- Date/time JSON backups
- Add user authentication to configuration page
- Test different configuration file write/read error scenarios
