# Redirector

Python Flask server that redirects visitors to other web page URLs.

Lots still to-do:

- Rename about page to landing page
- Configure favicon
- Add user authentication to configuration page
- Add redirect links list to landing page
- Split configuration and startup items from redirect items into seperate logs
- Add reorder arrows to config page
- Add grouping option to config page
- Test different configuration file write/read error scenarios
