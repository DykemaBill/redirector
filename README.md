# Redirector

Python Flask server that redirects visitors to other web page URLs.

Lots still to-do:

- Finalize work on configuration entry indexes
- Build option to add new redirect from the config page
- Move all CSS to one file
- Move all common HTML code such as titles and images to the json configuration file
- Log everything as the server runs
